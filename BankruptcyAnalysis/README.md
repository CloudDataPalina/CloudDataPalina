📊 **Dataset Overview**

This project uses financial data of a fictional company **"TechnoProm"** over a period of 5 years.  
The dataset is saved in [`techno_prom_financials.csv`](techno_prom_financials.csv) and contains:

- Revenue and cost of goods sold (COGS)
- Gross and net profit
- Administrative, marketing, and other expenses
- Depreciation and loan interest
- Year-end debt and cash flow
- Inventory, payables, and employee headcount

The goal is to analyze key drivers of financial downfall using **Python**, **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **matplotlib**.

## ✅ Project Goals

1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Compute and visualize **yearly profits**  
3. Analyze major expense categories and their impact  
4. Trace trends in debt, cash flow, and inventory over time  
5. Derive conclusions about the primary causes of financial collapse

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add `analysis.ipynb` with full Python analysis  
- Build visualizations (bar charts, line plots) using matplotlib  
- Summarize findings and conclusions in bullet points
