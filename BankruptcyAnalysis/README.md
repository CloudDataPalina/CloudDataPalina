## 🔍 Key Findings
-  Revenue declined by 38.5% (from 520K to 320K) — indicating loss of clients or demand
-  COGS increased by 13.8% (from 290K to 330K) — despite falling sales, efficiency worsened
-  Net Profit dropped from +100K to –290K — a full reversal into deep losses
-  Year-End Debt grew from 80K to 520K — a 6.5× increase, signaling rising insolvency risk
-  Profit Margins (Gross, Operating, Net) fell sharply and all turned negative
-  Admin & Marketing Costs doubled (from 80K to 155K), while revenue dropped — showing inefficient spending

## 💡 Recommendations

- 🧾 **Cut unnecessary overhead** — especially administrative and marketing costs  
- ⚙️ **Audit and optimize COGS** — improve supply chain and operational efficiency  
- 💳 **Restructure debt** — avoid new borrowing until financial stabilization  
- 🎯 **Focus on profitable segments** — shut down unprofitable business lines  
- 📊 **Implement strong financial analytics** — enable data-driven decisions and forecasting
