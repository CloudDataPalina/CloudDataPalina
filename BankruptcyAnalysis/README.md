## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset (`techno_prom_financials.csv`) includes annual data for Years 1–5 with the following columns:
- **Revenue** and **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
- **Gross Profit** and **Net Profit**
- **Administrative Expenses**, **Marketing & PR**, **Depreciation**, **Loan Interest**, **Other Expenses**
- **Cash Flow** and **Year‑End Debt**
- **Inventory**, **Payables**, **Employee Headcount**

We aim to uncover the key financial drivers behind the decline, focusing on operational efficiency, debt buildup, and cash flow trends.
